			<h2>Starting Position</h2>

			<p>Players shall stand in an upright hopping pose on one foot, behind the baseline of the court with the Hoppy Taw in one hand.</p>

			<h2>The Basic Toss</h2>

			<p>Hold the Taw between your thumb and your finger tips with your palm up, rotate your hand in toward your body and then rotate your hand out toward the court. Release the Taw to land flat in that perfect landing spot within the space you are aiming for.</p>

			<h2>Hints For Play And To Win</h2>

			<p>Tossing the Taw into a space - To make it easier to reach the Taw when you bend over to pick the Taw up, toss the Taw to that perfect landing spot.
			Hopping and jumping within the court - Keep your heels up off the line, stay on the front of your feet.</p>
